I study migrant integration and political behavior in the Middle East and the United States. My dissertation examines how interpersonal connections ("vitamin wow") influence migrant integration in Jordan. I teach courses including the Politics of the Middle East and Political Science Research Methods.

In my travels, Iâ€™ve picked up enough Arabic and Finnish to get by in either language. In my free time I enjoy reading, taking long naps, and hiking in new places!
